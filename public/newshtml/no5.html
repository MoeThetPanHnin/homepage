          Just 10 years ago we were completely fine with simple phones and we
          wrote people real letters on paper. Nowadays, we have lots of apps,
          a digital wallet, and a camera on our smartphones. Nevertheless,
          scientists and engineers don’t stop working hard in order to
          surprise us with their latest inventions. Some of them are already a
          part of our everyday life, and some just exist as projects for the
          moment.

          Bright Side collected 10 new smart gadgets that show how far new

          The laziest (or the most progressive) cat owners have already bought
          the automatic cat toilets for their pets. The robot litter box knows
          how to drop the waste into an isolated compartment, and the owner
          only has to open it, and remove and throw away a full bag.
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          This “smart litter box” looks very futuristic. By the way, it’s
          pricey but probably worth it at $450.

          It is difficult to imagine individual sports and fitness practices
          in the 21st century without special gadgets. Hula hoop enthusiasts
          from the United States installed sensors onto this piece of sporting
          equipment and behold the VHOOP, a smart hoop.

        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          The smart hula hoop has a movement sensor that tracks the intensity
          of your workout and sends the results to your smartphone. VHOOP has
          a workout mode and a competition mode with global ratings and a list
          of its best users.

          Recently, the British Condoms company released their newest
          invention, a “smart condom” called i.Con. It looks like a fitness
          bracelet but it’s meant for a different body part and it measures
          different activities. It can’t prevent pregnancy or the spread of
          disease but its creators are working on fixing that.
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          The sensors monitor the activity during a round of sexual
          intercourse — duration, intensity and speed of movement, the most
          popular positions and their frequency, the temperature of the
          organs, and the amount of calories burned. If the users would like,
          they can share their achievements with other users on the platform.

          Especially for frequent travelers who can’t imagine their life

        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          In order to use it, you won’t need any joysticks or difficult
          commands. It’s connected to a smart bracelet and rolls independently
          beside its owner. There’s also a normal handle. The suitcase is not

          The Walmart company applied for a patent for creating robot bees,

          The retailer actively supports environmental protection and
          “pollinator drones” would also work towards this initiative.

        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          According to the engineers, the drones can perform all the functions
          of real bees except for making honey. However, who knows what
          they’ll come up with going forward? In the near future, it will help
          to save lots of plants and develop agriculture in different parts of
          the world.

          Several years ago, some businessmen from Australia took out a patent
          for a special beehive that is very easy to use. The modular beehive
          can be mounted like a birdhouse and lets you not only contain the
          bees but also allows you to extract the honey.
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          The project impressed the users of one crowdfunding platform, so
          much so, that they already achieved their goal and launched
          productsion. Now the entrepreneurs are using crowdfunding again in
          order to gain capital to launch a new upgraded model of the beehive.

          inventions is IllumiBowl — a very simple lamp. It’s installed under
          the toilet rim and evenly lights all the space around it. Just
          imagine that you don’t need to turn on the light every time you go
          to the toilet.

          According to the producer, thanks to the special vibrations, their
          smart eye mask helps to normalize breathing and get rid of snoring.
          There’s a reason to believe them: their creation is not just a
          prototype anymore. It’s now being mass produced.

          This device, named Hushme, looks strange but it serves a very
          important purpose: it keeps everything you say a secret. This device
          helps you talk over the phone anywhere, without disturbing anyone
          around you. It’s very useful but the way it looks might need a
          little work.

          And, yes, Hushme can imitate the voice of Darth Vader.

          A couple of years ago Graham Dugoni was at a music festival. He was
          surprised by the behavior of some people: they made videos of their
          tipsy colleagues and put them online thinking it would be funny. It
          was then that Dugoni started thinking about how much we respect
          someone’s confidentiality and what it means nowadays. With this in
          mind he began his startup called Yondr.
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          Dugoni’s theory is that everyone can do without their smartphone for
          a few hours. For example, when they’re at a concert, while talking
          with friends, or when they’re at school. The company produces
          special phone cases that are locked with a magnet and can’t be
          unlocked without an administrator.
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          Before school, the kids put their phones into special cases and
          unlock them after their classes. This unique idea has had a lot of
          positive feedback, especially at schools in the United States.
