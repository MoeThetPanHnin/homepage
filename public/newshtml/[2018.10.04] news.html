          Why there’s a culture shift on the horizon
        </h2>
        <p class="news-opened__post-date">Oct 4, 2018</p>
      </div>
      <div class="news-opened__post-content">
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          The latest update to the BRC Global Standard for Food Safety will
          move the goalposts in terms of food and drink hygiene with companies
          under even greater scrutiny.
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          The more thorough the cleaning regime, the fewer bacterial problems
          a factory will face – at least, that’s the logic.
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          “If the basics are right in terms of a well-controlled,
          well-executed cleaning regime followed by a disinfectant regime, we
          see a big fall-off in bacterial and, to a degree, allergenic
          problems,” says Peter Littleton, vice-chair of the Society of Food
          Hygiene and Technology and technical director at Christeyns Food
          Hygiene.
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          “It’s where cleans are maybe not controlled as well as they could
          be, or rushed, that we see potential for pathogen survival ... and
          consumer risk.”
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          But cleaning regimes are only one part of the picture. In recent
          years, the role of a good food safety culture in alleviating
          contamination threats has gained traction, and this now been
          formally recognised in the latest update to the BRC Global Standard
          for Food Safety.
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          Issue 8 of the Global Standard (BRC8), which goes live on 1 February
          2019, has shifted the focus towards “encouraging development of
          products safety culture”. It also expands the requirements for
          environmental monitoring of food safety and encourages sites to
          further develop systems for security and food defence. For food and
          drink firms, the Standard will mean greater scrutiny than ever
          before.
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          As well as speciality detergents, disinfectants and associated
          chemicals, Christeyns offers add-on services, such as auditing and
          training, which Littleton says will be in even more demand when BRC8
          comes into force.
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          ‘Establishing a food safety culture’
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          “Good manufacturing and hygiene practices, in particular, have a big
          role to play in establishing a food safety culture, and maintaining
          it going forwards,” he says. “People actually doing the right thing,
          whether they’re watched or not, is going to be the complete thing
          for the industry come BRC8.”
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          Christeyns prefers on-site instruction to “talk and chalk” sessions
          in training rooms, which can be too time-consuming for industry.
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          “If you can deduct 20 minutes for listeria awareness on a productsion
          line, it’s a lot easier to project a real world example as everybody
          gets it straight away,” says Littleton. “But it’s also looking at
          what we can do with chemicals to try and improve their efficiency of
          use, dispensing and deployment.”
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          A notable success story for Christeyns has been a project for Greggs
          across its 1,900 bakery stores, replacing five-litre chemical drums
          with concentrated soluble sachets over a year ago.
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          Staff previously used swan necks to dispense the chemical, but the
          soluble sachets mean they no longer come into direct contact with it
          and less water is used.
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          Luckily, the technology has aligned with the Blue Planet II-prompted
          backlash against non-recyclable plastics. Already removing an annual
          3t of plastic from Greggs’ waste stream, this is set to increase to
          6.5t.
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          Another layer of complexity
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          Of course, using chemicals adds another layer of complexity to the
          cleaning process, with greater restrictions around the use of
          biocides such as quaternary ammonium compounds (quats) proving a
          particular challenge.
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          “We’ve lost the use of one of our main disinfectants, and the others
          are by and large more expensive, which means their use is
          curtailed,” says Littleton.
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          Research company Campden BRI has raised concerns over the
          implications of restricting quats on antimicrobial controls. It has
          also flagged up the impact the move may have on novel productss with
          unknown microbiology, or productss that contain few preservatives or
          have had little processing.
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          The craft beer trend is one such example. A reduction in processing
          during brewing may produce better flavours, but could also
          potentially introduce spoilage organisms.
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          To combat such problems, Campden BRI’s services include virus
          control, testing for STEC E.coli, and ‘challenge testing’ productss.
          Its wide microbial profiling service offers manufacturers the
          ability to improve shelf-life, hygiene, authenticity and
          traceability.
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          Swiss specialist Bühler offers ways to reduce the risk of
          contaminants across the low-moisture food and feed industry. Its
          Laatu system uses low-energy electron beam technology to
          significantly reduce harmful microorganisms such as salmonella,
          E.coli and spores in milliseconds.
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          “It is harsh on micro-organisms, yet as a surface treatment, it is
          gentle on food, with better preservation of nutrients and
          organoleptic properties,” says Dr Edyta Margas, food safety leader
          at Bühler. “In comparison with conventional technologies, Laatu has
          a significantly smaller footprint, and can be implemented anywhere
          in the processing line.”
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          Reducing energy consumption
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          Reducing energy consumption by up to 80% compared with steam
          systems, it is now available to the spice market and will be rolled
          out to other dry food markets in the future.
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          Other new technology on the market includes Stratio’s LinkSquare, a
          short wave infrared camera for collecting data to detect the
          freshness and, therefore, safety of produce including the presence
          of any dangerous pathogens.
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          By shining light on an object or liquid, and measuring its response
          to different wavelengths in seconds, it sends the results to an app
          on any smart device across iOS and Android applications.
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          Founded by graduates from Stanford University in California, Stratio
          is also developing BeyonSense – said to be the world’s first
          mobile-compatible shortwave infrared camera – for launch in early
          2019.
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          “We want to integrate LinkSquare and BeyonSense to make a
          spectroscope that can actually tell the hygiene and cleanliness of
          food,” says Jae Hyung Lee, founder of LinkSquare.
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          The technology could also potentially be used to detect fraudulent
          food and drink or even the presence of pesticides.
