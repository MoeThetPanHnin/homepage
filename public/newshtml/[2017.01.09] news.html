          10 ingenious smart devices built by startups at CES 2017
        </h2>
        <p class="news-opened__post-date">January 9, 2017</p>
      </div>
      <div class="news-opened__post-content">
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          The corporations at CES may have had the bigger halls,
          but the limelight shone just as bright on the little guys.
          Here’s why
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          As a first-timer to the Consumer Electronics Show (CES),
          it would be no exaggeration to say I was gobsmacked by
          how incredibly massive the show was. Halls after halls
          spread across the Las Vegas Convention Centre and other
          hotels overflowed with exhibitors, overpriced food stands,
          and throngs of attendees seeking to get a glimpse of
          technology’s future at #CES2017.
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          The big brands occupied the largest spaces.
          To give you a bit of context, Sony’s booth was more than
          half the size of e27‘s flagship Echelon Asia conference.
          Then there were whole swathes of sections areas dedicated
          to just showcasing drones, wearables, audio/video productss
          and a whole dizzying array of cool tech. The halls were
          so expansive the CES app itself had a GPS-enabled map
          that help you to navigate to each booth (and I’m not even
          going to go into the long snake queues for the buses that
          took you to other convention centres).
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          But despite the multitude of exhibition spaces, a substantial
          chunk of the startups were actually concentrated at
          the Eureka Park Marketplace, a relatively modest hall
          at the Sands Hotel.

        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          This is by no means meant to disparage or undervalue their accomplishments.
          In fact, it only serves to emphasise that niftiest – some wacky – innovations
          do not have to be clothed in flashiest outfits.

        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          Bellus3D face camera is so advanced it’s creepy. It is able to
          measure 500,000 points on a face to construct a hyper
          realistic 3D image of it – warts and all.
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          The camera attaches to the top of a smartphone via a
          USB cable and measures heat and light on the face.
          To do that, it has two 1.2 MP infrared sensors, one
          1.2 MP colour sensor, and two infrared laser
          structured-light projectors. An optional LED ring
          light can be attached for more accurate results.
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          Bellus3D claims it is able to scan a face up to a range
          of 1 metre, but the optimal distance is between 30 to 60cm.
          Currently, it is only available for Android devices.

          For diabetics, foot ulcers are a serious medical issue
          that can lead to amputation of the legs. Siren Care wants
          to tackle this paint point by developing smart socks that
          can track the temperature of the foot, which is then used
          to identify potential injuries. It is able to track six
          plantar positions on each foot. An alert is sent to the
          app once it has identified a hotspot.
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          The socks are machine washable. Just be sure not to
          lose them in the washing machine tumbler.

          Pavlok wants to help rid of bad habits — the hard way.
          The wearable is worn on the wrist and delivers a
          shock to the user when a bad habit is performed.
          Essentially, it is aversion therapy.
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          It syncs with Google chrome to track internet usage
          and browsing habits. So it tracks. So for example,
          if a user is on Facebook for too long, it will zap them.
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          Trying to go on a diet? Pavlok will track your arm movement
          and determine how many spoonfuls you had, and shock
          you if you go over a preset limit. Sleeping too much?
          It will track how long you have been inactive, and zap!
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          Of course, there are bad habits that are more abstract
          and harder to measure, such as being negative. What Pavlok
          suggested was users zap themselves whenever a bad thought
          comes up, so they will associate those thoughts with pain.
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">

        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          The zap has different levels of shock to cater to different pain thresholds.
          I tried on 20 per cent and it felt like a little sting
          (Pavlok offered to give me the full load, but I politely declined).
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          Pavlok also rewards good behaviour. For example, if it sees
          that you are getting less shocks (which would indicate an
          improvement in behaviour) it will reward the user with a
          soothing buzz.

          set diet and bodybuilding goals by inputting a desired body
          measurement. The app then tracks progress by informing the

          Tired of hearing your partner’s snores? Smart Nora won’t cure it,
          but it will help alleviate the problem. It uses a microphone
          (shaped in the form of a pebble) to first detect snoring sounds.
          Once it has captured the sound, an airbag placed underneath
          the pillow will be automatically inflated and deflated
          via a pump connected to a portable case.

          i-BLADES‘s phone case is more than just a case, it’s an expansion
          pack for the smartphone. A detachable pack is affixed
          to the case, providing more battery life and more memory.
          Additionally it has a built-in environment sensor that
          can measure air quality. i-BLADES claims this is only
          the beginning of a products series. The team hinted that
          future packs could be outfitted with sensors that can
          measure the body’s glucose levels and heart rhythms.
          And with its modular design, users can just stack the packs
