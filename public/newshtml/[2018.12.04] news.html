          From trendy eyewear to true wireless charging, the future doesn't
          look bad after-all...
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          Ever since the IoT (Internet of Things) category exploded a few
          years ago, the market began flooding with smart gadgets. Both
          established and start-up brands began putting chips in toasters,
          pillows, belts, tables, and whatnot. However, most of these productss
          were rushed to be the first one to jump on the “smart” devices
          bandwagon. Things haven’t changed much in 2018, as companies are
          still rolling out stupid gadgets such as a salt dispenser, comb, and
          Wi-Fi connected trash can! Thankfully, some brands are implementing
          the technology in sensible way. Let’s check out some of these
          innovations that can actually make your life easy or have a
          meaningful addition to the user experience.
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-title">Nuviz heads-up display</p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          Using GPS navigation in cars is quite convenient. Mount your
          smartphone on a holder and you are good to go. With right settings,
          you can keep the navigation screen and the road ahead in your field
          of view. Bikes, on the other hand, are a different ball game. You
          can’t view a bike’s dashboard without taking your eyes completely
          off the road. Goes without saying that it is very dangerous. And to
          solve this issue, Nuviz has introduced its heads-up display. Apart
          from navigation, this gadget can feed you music and lets you receive
          calls with minimum distraction. Moreover, it is equipped with an
          8-megapixel camera that can snap still and record HD videos. Priced
          at $699, the Nuviz heads-up display is powered by Qualcomm’s chip,
          has Wi-Fi connectivity, and draws power from a 3,250 mAh battery.
          The gadget will take some time to gain traction in the consumer
          market. But, food or grocery delivery start-ups such as Grofers and
          Swiggy can implement this technology for more efficiency in its
          logistics.

        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          Ever wondered how do we know the composition of heavenly bodies such
          as Neptune and Pluto? Well, scientists use orbiters equipped with
          infrared spectrometers to read the spectral signature of celestial
          bodies. Based on this data, we can understand the chemical
          composition of the atmosphere or surface layer of a planet. Stratio
          Inc. utilises this same space-age technology to address real world
          problem on Earth. The company developed LinkSquare, a handy
          spectrometer that can detect counterfeit medicine, cosmetics,
          currency, jewelry, and even freshness of fruits. LinkSquare analyses
          visible and near infrared light (400 nm – 1000 nm) to get the
          spectral fingerprints of an object. The information then passes
          through machine learning algorithms to determine the identity,
          authenticity, and degree of freshness of objects. The LinkSquare
          spectrometer can easily fit your pocket and its price starts at
          $549.

          Mars Translation Earbuds
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          Thanks to the air travel, the world is becoming smaller. But,
          languages still remain a barrier between people across the globe. In
          popular culture, including a Korean movie Snowpiercer, characters
          use a compact translator to overcome the language barrier. Taking
          inspiration straight from science fiction, Japanese Line
          corporation, which is a subsidiary of a Korean tech giant NAVER,
          developed Mars wireless earbuds to save you from getting lost in
          translation. What makes it better than Google’s Pixel Buds, is the
          fact that you can simply share one earbud with the other person to
          have a conversation across two different languages. The translation
          happens in real time using the data from cloud. In Pixel Buds, one
          has to talk via a connected smartphone. Mars currently support 10
          languages and 40 more languages are expected to be added soon.

        <p class="news-opened__post-content-title">Wi-Charge</p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          Smartphones have come a long way. We now have pixel-packed displays,
          excellent cameras, and powerful processors in the palm of our hand.
          However, there hasn’t been any significant improvement in the
          battery tech. As a result, we still have to charge our phones at
          least once in a day. Currently, the only workaround is to carry
          lousy power banks. Things may soon change for good though, as
          Wi-Charge has introduced truly wireless charging technology. It uses
          beams of infrared light to power-up compatible devices within a
          room. The setup includes a Wi-Fi router esque power transmitter and
          tiny receivers that can be connected to smartphones or other
          devices. The receivers use a miniature photovoltaic cell to convert
          transmitted light into electrical power. In future, smartphone
          manufacturers can choose to integrate the hardware int their
          handsets to do away with external receivers. The company claims that
          the beams coming from its Wi-Charge are safe for life forms and are
          approved by the US FDA.
