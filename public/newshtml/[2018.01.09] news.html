        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          A New Year means one thing in the world of gadgets — a trip to
          Las Vegas for CES. It’s the enormous consumer electronics show
          packed with nearly 50-football fields worth of shiny new tech toys.
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          Somewhere inside the cavernous convention center crowded with TV’s
          we can’t afford, concept cars we’ll never drive, and stupid
          “smart” things we’ll never use (Alexa-enabled toilet…really?),
          there’s always a handful of gadgets that really can hit the
          jackpot of products-perfection.
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          That’s what I set out to find early-on here in Las Vegas.
          Here are my favorites so far.
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          Something new under the sun
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          The smallest new wearable I’ve ever seen could also be
          one of the smartest when it comes to protecting your skin.
          L’Oréal’s new UV Sense is a tiny tracker that fits on
          your fingernail. But the diminutive dot packs enough tech
          to give you UV, pollen, humidity, temperature, and air quality
          levels. It uses NFC to pair with an app on your smartphone
          and can give you reminders to put on more sunscreen or stay
          out of the sun altogether.
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          Price: L’Oreal’s hope is to price it around $40, and will give it a
          limited release in the U.S. this summer, before it hits store shelves
          next year.

        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          The Lenovo Smart Display with Google Assistant could be to
          the next-generation smart home what the iPhones were to smartphones.
          Really. (The demo I saw was that good.) It’s a tabletop
          smart screen that acts as a touchscreen tablet, virtual personal
          assistant, and smart-home hub. With a gorgeous upscale design,
          it’s also pretty enough to keep on a countertop in your
          kitchen or perched on a bedside table.
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          You can set it up to say, "Hey Google," and start a routine:
          Turn on the lights, get the coffee brewing, read your
          daily schedule, give you traffic and weather reports,
          wake the kids, and remind you to feed the dog. You can
          also use it to video-call your mom, or watch the morning
          news while you eat breakfast.
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          If this all sounds like stuff you can already do with an existing
          connected home device like the Amazon Echo Show, that’s
          because it kind of is, except that the Lenovo Smart Display
          does it better, faster, and is a whole lot easier to use in
          general. It also has two additional features to address
          privacy concerns. You can mute the speaker, so it’s not listening
          for its wakeup word, and flip a switch to cover the camera
          (versus the DIY method of putting tape over it).
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          Price: Both the 10.1-inch and 8-inch models go on sale this summer, for $249 and $199.<br>

          When Merge VR first showed me their new plastic Nerf-like toy
          gun that pairs with an iPhone app to play games, I thought,
          so what? Then I played with it. It is is totally awesome.
          Called the Merge 6DoF Blaster, you slide an iPhone into a holder,
          fire up the app and just like that, you’re battling
          blaster-yielding space aliens. It’s VR, without any VR
          glasses or goggles! So, when the aliens shoot at you, you have
          to hide behind walls and duck under tables to dodge their
          laser beams. You’re in the game, but not at all out of touch
          with everything around you.
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          6DoF stands for “six degrees of freedom,” which is a buzzy
          term used a lot in virtual reality circles to describe being
          able to look and move all around, while still playing
          in a virtual world. That’s a good thing to be able to do
          with a headset, and kind of an amazing thing without it.
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          Price: The Merge 6DoF Blaster comes out this summer, likely
          for a price tag in the $50 dollar range.

        </div>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          Travis the Translator is the closest thing to a real-time
          language translator that I’ve ever seen. It’s about
          the size of a flip phone, and can translate 80
          languages with a SIM card or WiFi connection, or
          20 in offline mode. Let’s say you’re in Italy, don’t
          speak Italian, and need to ask for directions. You
          tap a little touchpad and scroll to pick the two languages,
          tap an arrow and speak normally. About a second after you
          stop talking, your question pops up in a small little
          window, in Italian, and a voice asks the question out-loud too.
          When it’s the other persons turn to talk, you tap another arrow,
          let Travis listen, and it repeats the answer back in English.
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          The company behind Travis told us they partnered with
          “the world’s best translation engines" for each language
          and that the gadget can even auto-detect languages, as well.
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          Price: Priced at $199 right now on Indiegogo,
          this palm-sized gadget could have a big impact on
          bridging cultural barriers.

          Imagine an Amazon Echo with a cute-as-can-be face. That’s BUDDY,
          one of the best “social companion” robots we saw at last year’s
          CES. It’s back this year and ready to go home with you — almost.
          It won’t hit stores until September, with a price tag of $1,500.
          So why fork over a small fortune for a cute hunk of plastic?
          I think of BUDDY as the entry point to the robot revolution.
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          Right now, the Google Assistant voice-controlled robot can
          roam around your house looking adorable and interacting with you.
          It can turn on music, show you the latest weather conditions on
          its little tablet-like face, answer simple questions, and
          even show a live feed of your house while you’re at work.
          It also told me a bunch of jokes, danced with me, and followed
          me around the showroom floor flashing impish smiles to make
          me laugh. While it won’t do dishes or fold laundry yet, BUDDY
          is still a newborn in the gadget world, with potential to grow
          into a cherished part of your household.

          If you’ve ever had food poisoning — which one in every six
          of us has according to the CDC — you’ll want to know
          about this gadget. The LinkSquare is a magic marker-sized
          scanner that can tell if meat is rotten — think salmonella,
          E. coli and norovirus — whether alcohol is fake,
          or prescription pills are what they’re supposed to be.
          Trust me, just because a pill looks like a pill doesn’t mean
          it is in fact the RIGHT pill. It can even tell if
          you the money in your pocket is counterfeit. It pairs
          with an app on your phone and the makers told me there
          are a lot more features to come.
