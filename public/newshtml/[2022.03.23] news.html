          Empire State Development (ESD) is New York’s chief economic development agency
          (<a href="https://esd.ny.gov/">www.esd.ny.gov</a>). The mission of ESD is to promote a vigorous and growing
          economy,
          encourage the creation of new job and economic opportunities, increase revenues
          to the State and its municipalities, and achieve stable and diversified local
          economies. Through the use of loans, grants, tax credits and other forms of
          financial assistance, ESD strives to enhance private business investment and
          growth to spur job creation and support prosperous communities across New York State.
          ESD is also the primary administrative agency overseeing the Regional Economic
          Development Councils and the marketing of “I LOVE NEW YORK,” the State’s iconic
          tourism brand. For more information on Regional Councils and Empire State Development,
