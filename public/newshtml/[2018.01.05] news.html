          GADGETS Here Comes CES 2018, the Biggest Gadget Show in the World—What to Expect
        </h2>

          In just a few days, upwards of 175,000 industry insiders, exhibitors,
          and members of the media will once again descend upon Las Vegas
          in attempts to set the pace of tech for the next 12 months.
          Not only will some of the world’s largest and most influential
          companies such as Samsung, LG, Ford, and others be in attendance,
          Vegas will also temporarily become home to more startups than
          anywhere else on the planet, all fighting for the kind of
          attention that could make or break their fledgling endeavors.
          Past breakouts include everything from an automatic wireless
          breast pump to virtual reality headsets, while other much-hyped
          debuts are still trying to make good on their promises.
        </p>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          Here at Gizmodo, we’ve been keeping track of everything we can,
          and while we might not be able to pinpoint every single rising
          star before the show starts, we’ve got more than enough info
          to highlight a number of major trends that are going to define
          this year’s CES. Here’s what we’re expecting so far.

        </div>
        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          Last year, one of the clear winners of CES was Amazon, which was
          quite impressive when you consider that the online shopping
          giant didn’t actually have an official presence or booth at the show.
          What really won it for Amazon was Alexa, which had every
          company from BMW to Mattel lining up to show off productss
          with featuring its digital assistant. For 2018, it’s clear
          that trend is only getting bigger, especially now that Google
          has had a full year under its belt and a chance to push out
          another round of AI-powered devices. But it’s not just smart
          speakers and digital assistants that are getting more intelligent.
          I’m talking about everything from smart tupperware to robotic
          sun shades, and more.

        <p class="news-opened__post-content-text">
          Even with all the wacky stuff that inevitably shows up,
          a big pillar for CES is still TVs. Like always, companies
          are going to be showing off their fancy new sets that you’ll
          be drooling about in January, but will have to wait until Black
          Friday so you can actually afford them. In fact, LG already
          got the festivities started early when it teased its new
          88-inch 8K TV just a couple days ago, the largest OLED set
          LG has ever made. And LG probably won’t be the only company
          trying to dazzle us with vibrant colors and tons of pixels.
          In past years companies like Sharp and Samsung, have shown off
          8K prototypes of their own.

          As far as cars go, the mission is clear, every company is working
          steadily to make self-driving vehicles a reality. That said,
          it could be a slower year for autos at CES, as it seems
          a many carmakers are holding big announcements for the
          Detroit Auto Show (or North American International Auto
          Show as it’s more formally known), which starts January 14th,
          just a few days after CES closes up. But there should
          still be plenty of new and exciting things to see including
          a new personal drone, improved Lidar and machine vision tech,
          and more scooters, bikes and hilarious looking single-person
          transports than you could ever want. We should even see
          the debut of a brand new car brand named Byton, which
          could become another Tesla competitor, or could turn into
          the next Faraday Future.

          While smartwatches didn’t pan out the way hardcore futurists
          thought they would, wearables are beginning to find their
          niche as devices that can monitor your health and fitness
          in ways people never thought possible. We’re talking way
          more than heart rates or step counts, think health tags
          that can disappear into various pieces of clothing, new
          devices that can monitor how healthy your hair is, or even
          a mod for your phone that can track blood pressure, SPO2 and more.
          And this is before you think about all the various sleep
          tracking devices. They won’t all be good, but that won’t
          stop companies from trying.

          <b>Everything Else</b><br>
          If all that isn’t enough for you, there are still other things
          like the rise oftrue wireless power transfer
          (instead of the weak ass pads I wrote about last week),
          weird stuff like the LinkSquare which scans food to see if
          its safe to eat, or the rebirth of once great gaming brands
          like Madcatz. And then there all the big giants like IBM,
          Intel and Qualcomm, which will be showing off things
          like quantum computers, new CPUs and how we might
          actually get wireless 5G connectivity sometime
          in the next five years.
